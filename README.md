# Project-Manager

### Description

This  application is a task manager that allows the user to do the following: 

* Create a task 
* Log the duration of the task
* Associate the duration with a deadline date 
* View all tasks with task info, sorted from most recent deadline 

### Technologies

* AngularJS Framework
* CSS - Foundation Library 
* ngStorage for Local Storage 
* NPM

### To Review Code

All the good stuff is here:
* HTML `public/index.html`
* AngularJS File `public/index.js`

### To Run 

In order to run this application use `npm start` and run using `localhost:3000/index.html`

\* - Do be advised that the Project Management database is currently unstable, and will reset every time the `npm start` script is run. I'm working on fixing this problem in a future release. Please donate to my Kickstarter... or hire me.
